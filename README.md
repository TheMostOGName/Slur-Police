# Slur-Police
A Discord bot which pings people when a slur is said, made by request.

Half of the files aren't even used anymore (leftover from my failed attempt at creating a slash command), I think it only requires index.js, slurs.json, and package.json. slurs.json is not included in the repo, because it contains a bunch of slurs that I don't feel comferable having on my public github. If you need to recreate it and don't know how, message me (Kenorbs#4955 on Discord).
